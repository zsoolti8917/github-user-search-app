## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- GSAP
- AXIOS


### What I learned

During the development of this app, I learned and practiced a lot while using APIs. I used the Axios library to interact with the API, which became increasingly familiar to me. I was introduced to a new application called Postman, which I used to analyze the API data. I added some error handling with a callback and a counter that triggers if the user is not found or when there are too many API requests in a short time. This was also my first project where I implemented dark and light themes. It was fun learning about this feature, and I added a script to check the base theme settings of the user and use a color palette according to the user's preference. Additionally, this was my first project using Tailwind CSS. Initially, it was overwhelming, but as I neared the end of this project, it became easier to use. I really like it and definitely plan to use it in future projects. I see a greater advantage of using it in React, where components are used, because in a simple HTML website like this, the large number of class names can be a bit overwhelming. In the end, I also used GSAP to animate everything and used JavaScript modules for the first time to import animation functions from the animations.js file to my ApiHandler.js file.

Overall, I really liked this project. It was challenging but also fun, and I learned a lot from it.

### Continued development

There is plenty of room for improvement in this project. One aspect that could enhance its appearance is implementing a real-time search as the user types in a name. I definitely want to try that, but I need to consider implementing a function to prevent excessive API requests with every keystroke. Additionally, more error checks and a test file to verify functionality would be beneficial. I may add these features later as well.
